# These lines are for ensuring there is no excitation at low Te.  Between
# pulses the electron temperature remains at a few thousand K, to avoid
# ChemKin crashes, and is maintained by "fake" heating reactions.  TeSS
# represents the approximate steady state electron temperature between 
# pulses, in eV.  kmax represents the maximum rate coefficient for 
# inelastic processes at TeSS, which is imposed.  Increasing kmax and 
# reducing TeSS will improve the quality of fits, but they must be chosen
# such that ChemKin does not crash between pulses.

# The silent parameter controls whether the rates are plotted between each 
# fitting.  A value of true means the fitting routine runs without input 
# from the user while a value of false will plot each fit with the data 
# from Bolsig+

# Additional lines can be added to 'rename' the products of processes 
# included in the Bolsig+ calculations.  For each species to be renamed, 
# include a line starting with the species name as it appears in the file,
# bolsigXSFile, followed by an equals sign, followed by the name to be used
# by ChemKin.  Species can only be renamed once, however multiple species 
# can be renamed to the same output species (i.e. N2(A3Sigma) and N2(B3Pi) 
# can both be renamed to N2*).  If multiple processes have the same
# product species, they will be combined into a single process prior to 
# curve fitting the rates.  Finally, if you want a process included in the 
# Bolsig+ calculation to be left out of the ChemKin calculation, simply 
# rename the product species to nothing (i.e. include a line 'N2(v1) = ' to
# ignore the excitation of N2(v1) in ChemKin).
