1) Run Bolsig for mixture
	- Mole fractions must be normalized by hand
	- Save data - separate tables vs energy
			uncheck "Selected items only"
2) Edit config.in for processor and run, making sure fits are reasonable
3) Create Chemkin Project
	a) Plasma PSR, Inlet, Product
	b) Click Update Project
	c) Open pre-processor, set working dir to a directory in the chemkin projects path
	d) add gas phase chem set and thermo file
	e) Run pre-processor - check any errors in log file and modify config.in and rerun matlab processor as neccesary
	f) Set inlet temp/mole fractions
	g) Set up PPSR
		i) Transient Solver
		ii) t_end, t_res, T, T_e, P, Vol
		iii) Power profile (import from csv)
		iv) set initial mole fractions
